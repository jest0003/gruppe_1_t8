      <h3>Why Castor Oil Is So Popular in Beauty</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Budget-friendly & simple — Pure castor oil is relatively inexpensive compared to many specialty serums.</li>

        <li>Multifunctional — It’s used across skin, hair, lashes, and brows.</li>
        <li>Rich in beneficial compounds — Castor oil contains ricinoleic acid, other fatty acids, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential which support healthy skin and hair.</li>

      <h3>Eyebrows & Eyelashes — Fuller & Darker?</h3>
      <p>
        Many beauty enthusiasts use castor oil on brows and lashes with the hope of thicker, darker hair. What does the evidence say? There is no definitive scientific proof that castor oil stimulates new eyelash growth. <br />What it may do: <br />
        - Improve glossiness of lashes and brows, making them appear fuller or healthier. <br />
        - Reduce breakage by providing nourishment and moisture to brittle hairs. <br />
        - Some anecdotal users report better retention of hairs (less fall-out). <br />
        <b> How to apply safely: </b><br />
        - Use a clean, small applicator (e.g. spoolie or clean mascara wand) <br />
        - Apply only to the lash line or brow hairs (not too close to the eye)

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        Final Thoughts Castor oil is not a magic elixir—but for those seeking a natural, low-cost, multipurpose ingredient, it offers solid benefits in hydration, hair and lash conditioning, and mild supportive properties for aging skin. And when
        used mindfully (quality, dosage, frequency), it can fit beautifully into an ethical, clean-beauty routine.
